# ProLexia
An application to add a coloured overlay onto the screen to help people with Irlen syndrome, visual stress and dyslexia.

ProLexia was created using .NET 4.8 and the Windows API. 

It is a transparent Windows Form that is maximized and always on top, but allows the user to click through to applications underneath. The colour and opacity are set via an options menu accessible from the system tray.
